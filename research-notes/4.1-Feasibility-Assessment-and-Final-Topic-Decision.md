## Part C: Final Topic Selection

### 1. Final Choice

My final project topic is **AI-Powered Phishing Detection System**.

This project will involve developing a machine learning-based system that can identify phishing emails using natural language processing (NLP) and URL feature analysis. I will build, test, and evaluate multiple models (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM) and design a simple web-based interface for real-time classification. The goal is to simulate a practical cybersecurity tool that combines data science and AI-driven threat detection.

### 2. Why This Topic

This topic strikes the optimal balance between achievability and challenge for my current skill level. The project is ambitious yet grounded in accessible technologies—Python's mature ML ecosystem and abundant learning resources create a solid foundation, while the security domain application adds meaningful complexity. Unlike the sandbox project, which could stall on virtualization or hardware issues, the phishing detection system allows for incremental, visible progress: I can start with basic text classification and progressively add sophistication.

What makes this personally meaningful is its direct impact on everyday security. Phishing remains the most common cyberattack vector, affecting individuals and organizations alike. Creating a tool that could actually protect people resonates with my motivation for entering cybersecurity. Additionally, this project perfectly combines two high-demand skill areas—artificial intelligence and security—positioning me strongly for modern SOC analyst or security engineering roles where automated threat detection is increasingly central.

The feasibility assessment reveals clear advantages: I have stronger baseline skills in Python and web development than in system administration and virtualization, all necessary resources are freely available, and the project's modular nature means even partial completion yields demonstrable value. I can develop and test models independently before integration, allowing parallel progress on multiple components.

### 3. Three-Tier Plan

- **Ambitious Goal:** Fully deploy the phishing detection system on AWS with live data ingestion, API endpoints, and dashboard visualization
- **Realistic Target:** Train a high-accuracy model (>85%) and integrate it into a basic web application for local or cloud testing
- **Minimum Viable Outcome:** Implement and evaluate an ML model that classifies phishing vs. legitimate emails in a controlled dataset

### 4. The Learning Value

Through this project, I will develop practical skills in machine learning, NLP preprocessing, cybersecurity automation, and web app deployment. Even if I do not reach the ambitious deployment stage, completing and documenting a functional model demonstrates valuable technical growth, analytical thinking, and problem-solving — all directly applicable to my future in cybersecurity and cloud-based threat detection.
