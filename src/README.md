# Source Code Directory

This folder contains the deployed AI-Powered Phishing Detection System and any custom code developed during the project.

## Contents

### `/AI-Powered-Phishing-Detection-System/`
Complete phishing detection system cloned from:  
https://github.com/GauravGhandat-23/AI-Powered-Phishing-Detection-System

**Key Files:**
- `phishing_detection.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `phishing_model.pkl` - Pre-trained Random Forest ML model
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- `emails.csv` - Sample email dataset

**To run this project:** See [Setup Guide](../docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md)

## Future Development

For my final project, I plan to build my own phishing detection system from scratch with:
- Custom dataset collection and labeling
- Comparison of multiple ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)
- Advanced NLP features (word embeddings, BERT)
- Enhanced web interface with confidence scores

That code will be added here as development progresses.
