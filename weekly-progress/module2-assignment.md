## Key Insights from Initial Research

**Finding 1: Random Forest is Highly Effective**
Multiple studies indicate Random Forest classifiers achieve 95%+ accuracy for phishing detection when properly trained.

**Finding 2: Feature Engineering Matters**
Success depends as much on *which* features you extract (URL characteristics, linguistic patterns, metadata) as on the algorithm used.

**Finding 3: Real-World Challenges**
Production systems must balance accuracy with speed, handle adversarial attacks, and minimize false positives to avoid alert fatigue.

**Finding 4: Active Research Area**
This is a rapidly evolving field with new papers published regularly, indicating strong industry and academic interest.

## Research Strategy for Module 3

**Next Steps:**
1. Deep dive into 2-3 key academic papers
2. Analyze specific GitHub implementations
3. Compare different ML approaches (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
4. Document detailed resource list with summaries
