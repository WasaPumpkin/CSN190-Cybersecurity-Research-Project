## Topic Comparison Summary

### AI-Powered Phishing Detection System

**Feasibility:** High (5/5)
- Accessible tools and resources
- Free datasets available (Kaggle, UCI)
- Manageable 8-10 week timeline
- Current skill level: 3.5/5

**Career Relevance:** High (5/5)
- AI security is fastest-growing field
- Directly applicable to SOC analyst roles
- Combines ML and cybersecurity skills

**Personal Interest:** High (5/5)
- Addresses real-world problem (90% of breaches)
- Visible, measurable results
- Exciting intersection of AI and security

---

### Malware Sandbox Environment

**Feasibility:** Moderate (3/5)
- Complex system-level configuration
- Hardware-intensive requirements
- Difficult 8-10 week timeline
- Current skill level: 2/5

**Career Relevance:** Moderate-High (4/5)
- Valuable for malware analysis roles
- More specialized than ML security

**Personal Interest:** Moderate (4/5)
- Technically fascinating
- Safety and complexity concerns

## Final Decision: AI-Powered Phishing Detection System

### Why This Topic

This topic strikes the optimal balance between achievability and challenge. It's ambitious yet grounded in accessible technologies—Python's mature ML ecosystem provides a solid foundation, while the security application adds meaningful complexity. Unlike the sandbox project which could stall on virtualization issues, phishing detection allows incremental progress with visible results.

**Personal Meaning:** Phishing affects everyone daily. Creating a tool that actually protects people resonates with my motivation for entering cybersecurity.

**Strategic Value:** Combines two high-demand skills (AI + security), positioning me strongly for modern SOC and security engineering roles.

## Three-Tier Implementation Plan

### Ambitious Goal 🚀
Fully deploy phishing detection system on AWS with:
- Ensemble ML models (>90% accuracy)
- Live data ingestion and API endpoints
- Dashboard visualization
- Browser extension prototype for Gmail

### Realistic Target 🎯
Complete functional system featuring:
- Three trained models (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM)
- Working Streamlit web interface
- 85%+ accuracy with documented metrics
- Clean GitHub repository with comprehensive README
- 10-12 page final paper

### Minimum Viable Outcome ✅
Deliver proof-of-concept with:
- At least one functioning classifier (Random Forest)
- 70%+ accuracy with documented evaluation
- Jupyter notebook showing complete workflow
- Final paper documenting approach and learning

---

## Learning Value

**Skills to Develop:**
- Machine learning (scikit-learn, model evaluation)
- NLP (text preprocessing, feature extraction)
- Web deployment (Streamlit)
- Technical documentation
- Research integration

**Why Attempting This Matters:**
Even if I don't achieve every ambitious goal, the learning process develops practical cybersecurity and ML skills directly applicable to my career goals. The minimum viable outcome still demonstrates valuable capabilities to employers.
