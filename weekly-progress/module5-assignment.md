## Abstract

Phishing attacks represent the most common cyberattack vector, with over 90% of data breaches beginning with a phishing email, yet traditional rule-based detection systems struggle to identify sophisticated attacks and generate high false-positive rates that burden security teams. Current detection methods fail to adapt to evolving phishing techniques that employ advanced social engineering and domain spoofing tactics. This project develops and evaluates a machine learning-based phishing detection system that combines natural language processing and URL feature analysis to classify emails with high accuracy in real-time. The system will be implemented using Python with scikit-learn and NLTK libraries, trained on publicly available datasets containing legitimate and phishing emails from Kaggle and UCI repositories, and tested through multiple classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. Performance will be evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, with comparative analysis identifying the optimal model for deployment. A web-based interface will be developed using Flask or Streamlit to demonstrate real-time classification capabilities in a simulated environment. This research aims to achieve detection accuracy exceeding 85% while minimizing false positives, contributing a practical, deployable tool that demonstrates the effectiveness of AI-driven threat detection for improving organizational email security posture and protecting users from phishing attacks.

### What Makes This Abstract Strong:

**Specific and Measurable:**
- Concrete statistics (90% of breaches)
- Named exact technologies (Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, Streamlit)
- Specific algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM)
- Measurable success criteria (>85% accuracy)

**Clear and Focused:**
- Active voice throughout
- Specific evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Well-defined scope and deliverables

---

### Challenges Faced

**Challenge 1:** Balancing completeness with word limit - initially included too many preprocessing details that didn't fit.

**Solution:** Focused on high-level approach rather than granular implementation details.

**Challenge 2:** Avoiding vague language like "various techniques."

**Solution:** Named specific algorithms and tools throughout.

### Alignment with Feasibility Analysis

This abstract reflects my **realistic target** from Module 4:
- 85%+ accuracy goal matches stated target
- Basic web application (Streamlit) rather than AWS deployment
- Accessible tools (scikit-learn, public datasets)
- Comparative algorithm evaluation approach
- Acknowledges my 3.5/5 skill level by choosing proven, accessible technologies
